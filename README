I don't like the View that pystache provides.

My alternative will use something like:

for cls in self.__class__.mro():
    [f for f in cls.__dict__.values()
             if inspect.isfunction(f) and
                 not f.func_name.startswith('_')]

to construct dicts to pass to render() per class.

It will also provide, through some genius I've yet to clarify, the render
results of the subclass to their superclass.

The idea is that you can have a template with {{& _content_}} that will then be
populated by a subclass.
